# Starby's Cup Corner

This project was created for project #2 in the u of mn fullstack coding bootcamp (summer-fall 2023).

The purpose of this web application is to allow users to create an account, search for Starbucks™ cups that other user's are selling and also allow users to post their own cups.

We used a variety of technology from HTML-CSS-JS to Express and Handlebars.
